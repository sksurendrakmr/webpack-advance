Asset Modules
======
Asset modules is a new feature introduced in webpack 5.
It allow us to use asset files in our javascript application
without installing additional dependencies.

However, we still need to make changes to our webpack 
configuration in order to teach webpack how to import those
asset files. (images, plain text,fonts)


There are four types of asset modules we can use
===
1. asset/resource
    ======
    Emit files into the output directory and exports the URL to that file.
    
    This type of asset module can be used to import large images or large font files.

2. asset/inline
    ===
    Inline the file into the bundle as a data URI.
    
    It can be used when importing small asset files like SVG.
    
    Usually SVG are injected into the javascript bundle as the data URI.
    
    It doesn't generate a new file in the output folder.

3. asset 
    ===
    Serves as a combination of the previous two asset types.
    
    If we decide to use a general asset type, webpack will automatically
    choose between asset resource and asset inline.
    
    If the file size is less then 8KB, this file will be treated as inline asset module,
    else resource asset module.

    We can configure the size to anything we want.

4. asset/source
    ===
    Sometime, we need to import some plaintext data as a javascript string.
    E.g. a text file that has some data as plain text.

    Import the source code of the file as it is and injects it into
    the javascript bundle as a string of text.
